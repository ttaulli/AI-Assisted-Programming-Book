# Python

This project uses Python with the following styles:

- All models will be classes with singular naming (i.e. User for the users table)
- Indent with 4 spaces ONLY
- Variables will be snake_case
- Constants will be in all caps with underscores (i.e. MAX_USERS)
- All functions will be in snake_case
- All code files will be lower case with underscores.
- Markdown files will be lower case with hyphens.
- All application logic will go in the lib directory
- All configuration will be done with environment variables, using a .env file.
- Do not export a class directly, use a factory function or method to create the instance you need

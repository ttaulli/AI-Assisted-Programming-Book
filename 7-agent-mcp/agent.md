Creating an app

Prompt:  I want to create a web application that provides weather information for a given city.  I want to use a free API.  Also, what do you suggest for the tech stack?

In the terminal:  npx create-next-app@latest . 

npm run dev

Prompt: Let's create a NextJS app for this.  Use the OpenWeatherMap API.  I have setup NextJS app in the directory 7-agent-mcp/weather-app.  Create a page that allows users to enter a city name and displays the current weather information for that city.

Selection:
- Nextjs
- OpenWeatherMap API
- https://openweathermap.org/api

- Agent and unit testing

# Unit Tests

- GitHub Copilot can create test cases
- Can't do everything
- But provide a good start
- Different types of unit testing frameworks
- In your prompt, specify the framework
- Chat tends to have more tests than using in-line chat
- /tests and run it 
- tests.py
